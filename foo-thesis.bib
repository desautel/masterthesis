  journal = {Computer Graphics Forum},

  volume = {26},
  pages = {571-579(9)},
  abstract = {A blurry background due to shallow depth of field is often desired
	for photographs such as portraits, but, unfortunately, small point-and-shoot
	cameras do not permit enough defocus because of the small diameter
	of their lenses. We present an image-processing technique that increases
	the defocus in an image to simulate the shallow depth of field of
	a lens with a larger aperture. Our technique estimates the spatially-varying
	amount of blur over the image, and then uses a simple image-based
	technique to increase defocus. We first estimate the size of the
	blur kernel at edges and then propagate this defocus measure over
	the image. Using our defocus map, we magnify the existing blurriness,
	which means that we blur blurry regions and keep sharp regions sharp.
	In contrast to more difficult problems such as depth from defocus,
	we do not require precise depth estimation and do not need to disambiguate
	textureless regions.},

  abstract = {The difficulty of preserving edges is central to the problem of smoothing
	images. The main problem is that of distinguishing between meaningful
	contours and noise, so that the image can be smoothed without loss
	of details. Substantial efforts have been devoted to solving this
	difficult problem, and a plethora of filtering methods have been
	proposed in the literature. Non-linear filters have proved to be
	more efficient than their linear counterparts. Here, a new nonlinear
	filter for noise smoothing is introduced. This filter is based on
	the psychophysical phenomenon of human visual contrast sensitivity.
	Results on real images are presented to demonstrate the validity
	of our approach compared to other known filtering methods},

  abstract = {The structure tensor, also known as second moment matrix or Frstner
	interest operator, is a very popular tool in image processing. Its
	purpose is the estimation of orientation and the local analysis of
	structure in general. It is based on the integration of data from
	a local neighborhood. Normally, this neighborhood is defined by a
	Gaussian window function and the structure tensor is computed by
	the weighted sum within this window. Some recently proposed methods,
	however, adapt the computation of the structure tensor to the image
	data. There are several ways how to do that. This chapter wants to
	give an overview of the different approaches, whereas the focus lies
	on the methods based on robust statistics and nonlinear diffusion.
	Furthermore, the data-adaptive structure tensors are evaluated in
	some applications. Here the main focus lies on optic flow estimation,
	but also texture analysis and corner detection are considered.},

  abstract = {Image smoothing is a critical preprocessing step in many image processing
	tasks. In this paper, a generalized edge-preserving smoothing model
	is derived from robust statistics theory, and its connections to
	anisotropic diffusion and bilateral filtering are established. The
	relationships allow us to derive an improved numerical scheme in
	the context of a robust estimation process for edge preserving smoothing.
	Experiments illustrate that the proposed smoothing algorithm is capable
	of effectively reducing the distracting effects of noise without
	sacrificing image edge structures. The robust edge-preserving smoothing
	method performs several dB better in terms of PSNR compared to anisotropic
	diffusion, bilateral filtering and the Bayes least squares Gaussian
	scale mixtures a wavelet-based methods for image enhancement.},

  abstract = {Tensors are a useful tool for the detection of low-level features
	such as edges, lines, corners, and junctions because they can represent
	feature strength and orientation in a way that is easy to work with.
	However, traditional approaches to define feature tensors have a
	number of disadvantages. By means of the first and second order Riesz
	transforms, we propose a new approach called the boundary tensor.
	Using quadratic convolution equations, we show that the boundary
	tensor overcomes some problems of the older tensor definitions. When
	the Riesz transform is combined with the Laplacian of Gaussian, the
	boundary tensor can be efficiently computed in the spatial domain.
	The usefulness of the new method is demonstrated for a number of
	application examples.1},
