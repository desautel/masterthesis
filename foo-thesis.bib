Clustered Shading [Olsson et. al. 2012] is a new lighting technique that offers compelling advantages over previous methods such as Tiled Deferred and Forward+. It scales better with complex scenes, while also offering more flexibility and fewer hassles. It is a unified lighting solution that works well with transparency, MSAA, and custom material and lighting models, without requiring extra passes or even necessarily a pre-z pass.

This session introduces the latest academic research on this technique, then reviews the adapted version of the technique that is currently in production at Avalanche Studios and the key differences between the implementations and their implications.},

abstract = { Abstract In this article we describe and investigate tiled shading. The tiled techniques, though simple, enable substantial improvements to both deferred and forward shading. Tiled Shading has been previously discussed only in terms of deferred shading (tiled deferred shading). We contribute a more detailed description of the technique, introduce tiled forward shading (a generalization of tiled deferred shading to also apply to forward shading), and a thorough performance evaluation. Tiled Forward Shading has many of the advantages of deferred shading, for example, scene management and light management are decoupled. At the same time, unlike traditional deferred and tiled deferred shading, full screen antialiasing and transparency are trivially supported. We also present a thorough comparison of the performance of tiled deferred, tiled forward, and traditional deferred shading. Our evaluation shows that tiled deferred shading has the least variable worst-case performance, and scales the best with faster GPUs. Tiled deferred shading is especially suitable when there are many light sources. Tiled forward shading is shown to be competitive for scenes with fewer lights, and is much simpler than traditional forward shading techniques. Tiled shading also enables simple transitioning between deferred and forward shading. We demonstrate how this can be used to handle transparent geometry, frequently a problem when using deferred shading. Demo source code is available online at the address provided at the end of this paper. }
