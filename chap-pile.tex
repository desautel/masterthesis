\chapter{Concept}

\section{Lighting Pipeline Overview}

\section{Virtual Point Light Sampling with Reflective Shadow Maps}
Use RSMs because fast rasterization.
Regular sampling. Refer to \citep{hedman2016sequential} for something better.

\section{Solving Occlusion with Imperfect Shadow Maps}
mainly ISMs \citep{ritschel2008ism} with tesselation \citep{barak2013temporally} because that requires no precomputation.

\section{Interleaved and Clustered Deferred Shading}
Interleaved shading \citep{Keller:2001:Interleaved} (nothing about non-interleaved!) and clustered deferred shading \citep{olsson2012clustered}

\section{Removing Lighting Singularities through Clamping}
It's simple, we clamp the singularities.
